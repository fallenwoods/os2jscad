## Introduction

os2jscad converts OpenScad programs to OpenJScad programs. Unlike the translator built into OpenJScad, this does a
conversion to javascript, retaining the origional program structure.





Built on Chevrotain is a [**blazing fast**][benchmark] and [**feature rich**](http://sap.github.io/chevrotain/docs/features/blazing_fast.html) **Parser Building Toolkit** for **JavaScript**.
It can be used to build parsers/compilers/interpreters for various use cases ranging from simple configuration files,
to full fledged programing languages.
