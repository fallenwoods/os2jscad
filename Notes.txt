Troubleshooting
Cannot use 'in' operator to search for 'extrude2d' in undefined

<function> is not defined:    libraries are defined out of order.
wrong arguments: The translator wrapped arguments in an object, but the openjscad code won't accept an object as an arg.
  e.g translate(v=[1,2,3]) becomes translate ({v:[1,2,3]}) which is not allowed by openjscad
Cannot read property 'length' of undefined: return an empty value (or empty array?) (comment after return w/o the rest of the statement.

parametrix_involute_gear_v5.0
  bad if() echo in gear() (Fixed)
  2nd assign stmt in involute_gear() disappears (fixed)
  setDefaults was not called for bevel_involute_gear_tooth() because it had no defaults (fixed)
  involute_facets was not set. Was passed as 0, in a?a?undefined and so ended up undefined (fixed)
  let of finsh after it's defined in bevel_gear() (fixed with var)
  fn not defined (added it by hand to test)
  Renders, but looks nothing like the original. Not sure I feel like debugging it.

  issue with var in front of return in forLoop
  Still has issues with squares not being centered.

  libpathextrude.torusknot is not a function
  a var is set to the result of a function
  the functions are not 'lifted' because they are assigned to the base class for export.
