parametrix_involute_gear_v5.0
  bad if() echo in gear() (Fixed)
  2nd assign stmt in involute_gear() disappears (fixed)
  setDefaults was not called for bevel_involute_gear_tooth() because it had no defaults (fixed)
  involute_facets was not set. Was passed as 0, in a?a?undefined and so ended up undefined (fixed)
  let of finsh after it's defined in bevel_gear() (fixed with var)
  fn not defined (added it by hand to test)
  Renders, but looks nothing like the original. Not sure I feel like debugging it.

  libpathextrude.torusknot is not a function
  a var is set to the result of a function
